Release v1.0.0

Release Vocab as v1.0.0 to signify a stable API and support future [semver versioning](https://semver.org/) releases.

Vocab has seen a lot of iteration and changes since it was first published on 20 November 2020. We are now confident with the API and believe Vocab is ready for common use.
